            <h3 className='text-center '> Difference between authorization and authentication:</h3>
            <h3> Authentication</h3>
            <p>Authentication is the process of identifying someone's identity by assuring that the person is the same as what he is claiming for. <br />
                It is used by both server and client. The server uses authentication when someone wants to access the information, and the server needs to know who is accessing the information. The client uses it when he wants to know that it is the same server that it claims to be.
            </p>
            <h3> Authentication</h3>
            <p>Single-factor authentication is the simplest way of authentication. It just needs a username and password to allows a user to access a system. <br />As per the name, it is two-level security; hence it needs two-step verification to authenticate a user. It does not require only a username and password but also needs the unique information that only the particular user knows, such as first school name, a favorite destination. Apart from this, it can also verify the user by sending the OTP or a unique link on the user's registered number or email address.
